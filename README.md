# Enhancing-Image-Resolution-With-Autoencoders
use Keras with Tensorflow as its backend to train an autoencoder, and use this deep learning powered autoencoder to significantly enhance the quality of images. That is, this neural network will create high-resolution images from low-res source images.


# Project Structure
    Task 1: Build the Encoder
    Task 2: Build the Decoder to Complete the Network
    Task 3: Create Dataset and Specify Training Routine
    Task 4: Load the Dataset and Pre-trained Model
    Task 5: Model Predictions and Visualizing the Results



note : the data provided is subset from all the dataset
